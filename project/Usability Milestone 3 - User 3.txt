What tasks did you give your user to perform?
Play a Game of Hanabi with 2nd player who knew Hanabi

What tasks were difficult for the user to complete, and why?
Took a few turns to learn how Hanabi worked, but once understood successfully played most of a game.
They accidently clued a color when they meant to clue a number. (Not sure if button confusion, or player logic)

Played the game over a longer period of time (doing things in between) and found success.

Clues and Numbers helped player remember what action to take when they sat back down.
Asked if we might send a message to player when it is there turn and indicate what action had been taken while away.

Did you encounter any surprising observations with your user behavior?
Player needed to have explaination of how Hanabi is played before successfully playing. 
Once understood game then seemed to have alot of fun.

How do you intend to respond to your user's feedback?
Visually distinguish the Clue Color and Clue Number Button so player doesn't accidently click on the wrong one
