You are responsible for submitting a usability report that details the following:

What tasks did you give your user to perform? 
We asked our teste to Play a card

What tasks were difficult for the user to complete, and why?
The player clicked on the card that was visible to try and play the card.
They expected it to go to the middle of the screen
They then noticed the buttons and said "oh maybe it doesn't know if I want to discard or play it."
they then clicked on the play button.
They were surprised when it didn't work
"I thought that would play the card"
They then tried to click the button and then click on the card. That didn't do anything either
"Maybe you can only clue a card"
Clicked on clueNum, and then card (feature hadn't been added yet so didn't work)

They then told me that the game doesn't seem to be playable


Alternatively, what tasks were completed with ease?
They could begin a new game with no difficulty

Did you encounter any surprising observations with your user behavior?
Even though they were familiar with how Hanabi is played, they thought they could play the cards that were visible.
They also had problems identifying who's turn it was, and which hand belonged to each player

How do you intend to respond to your user's feedback? 
We will implement a feedback that directs the user to click Play or Discard before clicking on a card, and to play cards from "thier" hand 
We can also change the labels on the hands to indicate which hand belongs to each player.
Lastly we can add to the UI an indication of whose turn it is.
