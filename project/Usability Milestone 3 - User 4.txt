What tasks did you give your user to perform?
Play a game of Hanabi with themselves. Goal is to build series of cards collaboratively. 

What tasks were difficult for the user to complete, and why?
Player expected to click the card and then be able to say what they wanted to do. 
They felt it was backwards to click the action first
 
Didn't realize that you could play multiple stacks of colors. When he played a blue 1 he kept looking and discarding. I promted him to play a green 1 and he was suprised it played

Didn't notice that they got a clue back when discarding, so they thought that action was pointless

When they logged in nothing displayed. We had to hit refresh to make it work.

Since the game is called Fireworks, he thought Fireworks were success indicators


Did you encounter any surprising observations with your user behavior?

I was surprised that he didn't play multiple ones until promted 
He would click on the alert menu quickly and wanted a log that he could use to read any messages he missed
