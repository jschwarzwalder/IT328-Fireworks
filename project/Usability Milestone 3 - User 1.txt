What tasks did you give your user to perform?
Play a Game of Hanabi with 2 players
What tasks were difficult for the user to complete, and why?
User and partner didn't know how Hanabi worked, They were both looking at the screen to play cards.
They liked the popup that told them the hand was not their hand.
Got excited when played a card successfully
Did not give eachother clues, instead they pointed at the screen and reminded player "Remember that is a 1"


Did you encounter any surprising observations with your user behavior?
I expected the users to play the Fireworks game avoiding each other's hands. 
I think if I added a tutorial or removed the hotseat feature that it would be more successful.

How do you intend to respond to your user's feedback?
Considering building a tutorial
