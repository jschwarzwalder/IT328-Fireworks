What tasks did you give your user to perform?
Play a Game of Hanabi with 2nd player who knew Hanabi

What tasks were difficult for the user to complete, and why?
User  didn't know how Hanabi worked. 
Clued opponent a 4
Then when clued a 1 clued opponent the color of one of the 4s

Did look away when not their turn.

When I promted and asked him how do you think you would play a card he said he didn't know

Discarded a card from hand 

Decided to stop playing at that point. 

Did you encounter any surprising observations with your user behavior?
He couldn't figure out how to play a card. Which I found odd since he was able to give clues and figured out how to discard

How do you intend to respond to your user's feedback?
Considering building a tutorial that explains how to play, but also what play, clue num, clue card, and discard do.
